Prostate Cancer Detection and Risk Classification using MRI Scans

This project focuses on detecting prostate cancer and classifying its risk levels using MRI scans as the sole input. The models were built through extensive experimentation, leading to the creation of over 100 machine learning models aimed at achieving the highest accuracy in both detection and risk stratification.
Key Features

    Prostate Cancer Detection: Predicts the presence or absence of prostate cancer from MRI images.
    Risk Classification: Classifies the risk level of prostate cancer into categories such as low, medium, and high.
    Extensive Model Development: Over 100 models were experimented with to optimize the performance, using various machine learning techniques.

Dataset

The models were trained using MRI scan data sourced from Prostate MRI US Biopsy dataset with over 1 lakh MRI images. The dataset includes labeled images, providing a mix of different prostate cancer stages and risk classifications.
Models Developed

    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    Ensemble Methods
    Classical Models (Random Forests, SVMs , Naive Bayes Classifiers , MLP, K means Clustering etc.)

The models were trained and optimized through extensive experimentation, including hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation techniques.

Results

    Accuracy: 85.03 percent for detection and 60.71 percent for cancer risk classification
    MSE - minimum of 0.4265 for cancer risk detection using regressors

The models have demonstrated strong performance in terms of both detection accuracy and risk classification.
